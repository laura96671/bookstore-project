# The Idea 
What should I read next? The bookstore web app allows users to go through a questionnaire that once completed, displays a list of suggested books based on the results of the questionnaire itself. Each item can be added to the "What to read next" list on the personal area and bought through an Amazon referral link.
<br/>
<br/>

## About The Project
Bookstore project made with Django, HTML and CSS. Class-based and functional views have been used throughout the project to handle main logics (book lists, products creation, registration/login form, products filtering), as well as Javascript for UI and PostgreSQL for database. The web app is Dockerized.
